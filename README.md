# Javascript Keyboard Drumkit

I made this app following one of Wes Bos' javascript 30 tutorials.  The app is a complete drumkit triggered completely by your keyboard.  The app is pretty simple in that I use a data key and and audio element that corresponds to that key.  I added some css to gives the look that the key expands and jumps out of the page a bit when pressed
